Hi, I'm Bengielyn Danao and welcome to my page! 

**I am a junior data scientist and an aspiring data science leader.** As a materials engineer, I studied how to optimize material structures and manufacturing processes to achieve certain properties. Just like data science, it is an innovative field that requires imagination. Both involves sleuthing through and manipulating information / resources available to reach a desired result.

Over the years, I got more and more interested in solving multidisciplinary problems. It's perfect how data science is industy agnostic that maximizes math, science, and technology to solve varied real-world problems such as business and public policies. It's all about finding the right framework to come up with a creative/efficient approach. I learn new things with every project I do and I enjoy the process very much. As I explore and enhance my skills, I will be sharing some of my favorite projects here. 

When I am not in front of my laptop, you will most likely find me doing yoga or going for a swim. I also recently discovered the joy of baking and I have a few recipes lined up that I want to try! :)
