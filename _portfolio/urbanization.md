<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This was a final project output for our <b>Data Visualization & Storytelling</b> class under Prof. Erika Legara in the M.Sc. Data Science program. We collected data, including historical national population and GDP, and came up with a story that tells the impact of urbanization in Metro Manila. For this project, we used Tableau for the visualizations. This was presented to class last April 2019. </p>

<h2>Report</h2>
As the global landscape continues to evolve, one key theme in driving change is urbanization. Socioeconomic aspects, such as the presence of more jobs and better pay, draw majority of the world's population towards urban areas.

Did you know that the Philippines is home to one of the densest cities in the world? The population density of Metro Manila is so high that it's actually at 20,785 people per square kilometer - that is 60 times larger than the national level which 337 people per sq km - and there's no sign of this slowing down. The urban share (percentage of urban population) has continued to grow by 4.5% annually from the year 2000 to 2017 and it's projected that by 2050, our urban population would make up a total of 61.71% of the national population. That means there will be more than half of the total national population in concentrated urban areas compared to rural. What does that mean for our country? There would be a stronger centralization effect to urban areas. 

The Philippines, from 2010 to 2017, has experienced 6-7% of steady GDP growth rate. Now 62% of the country's economic activity for those yeares is concentrated in the National Capital Region, Calabarzon, and Central Luzon.

When there's urbanization it is expected that economic activity is better because everything is in one area. However, this has an adverse effect especially with social inclusion. As more people move towards urban centers, these cities are starting to struggle with meeting the demands of a growing population. More importantly, they don't really have the land capacity anymore. This usually overflows to neighboring areas. Here we try to make a case that Metro Manila is dense and so are the edge cities around it like Calabarzon and most of Central Luzon.

The adverse effects can also be observed through the years. It can be seen that employmnet has shifted from agriculture to services since 1994. This just goes to show that rural areas, where agriculture jobs are present, are losing its people to the service-focused central cities. Moreover, in Calabarzon, more than 12 hectares of agricultural land was converted into residential and industrial areas. In effect, food demand and price increase.

Needless to say, this also results to the increase of informal settlements. About 1.3 million out of the 2.2 million informal settlers in the Philippines are found in Metro Manila. This gives rise to inequality. Limiting economic development in urban centers promotes a surge of internal migrations which decrease the qaulity of life of the general population. This ineffective planning of land use as well as the lack of proper regulations lead to the mismanagement of urban development. 

This begs the question, why can't we be like megacities like Seoul and Tokyo? Well, aside from being cities far longer than we have, they focus on equitable developments. It's not more of centralizing development in South Korea or Japan's urban areas but they make sure to move towards trickling down development to other areas. They invest in secondary cities while also studying how to design communities with the welfare of individuals in mind. They're designing solutions for communities rather than just designing solutions to answer one problem at a time.

Manila actually ranks among the worst in terms of its sustainability score. What can we do to change this? To ensure social mobility and quality of life, we should invest in secondary cities to spread economic growth across regions. A cohesive strategy on urban development is needed to maximize the benefits of agglomeration. Lastly, different sectors should address economical, spatial, and social dimensions of inclusions.
